# Solidity

Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Solidity has a syntax similar to JavaScript and is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. It compiles to bytecode, which is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Developers can write, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) using Solidity, enabling functionalities such as token creation, decentralized finance, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

## Basic Contract

This Solidity file defines a smart contract, which demonstrates basic functionality, including state variable name, creating a constructor, implementing string, storage, payment, storage, and calculator functions.
