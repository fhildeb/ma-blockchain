## Account Balance Search

This JavaScript file demonstrates a simple search algorithm to find the balance of an account based on a given hashed address. It define a target hash representing the address, iterates through a range of values (up to a maximum amount) and hashes each value using the RSA-SHA256 algorithm. These computed hashes are then compared with the target hash, and if they match, the balance of the account is printed to the terminal.

## Development

```
node search-balance.js
```

## Output

```
Match: Account balance is 3541068
```
