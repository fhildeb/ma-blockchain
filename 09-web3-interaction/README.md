# Web3 Interactions

This script interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and includes a series of asynchronous functions that fetch various types of information from the blockchain, such as block number, client version, network ID, gas price, genesis block hash, gas limit, Ether balance of an address, the number of transactions in a block, and transaction details. It also includes local functions to display the Web3 version, calculate SHA3 hash, and convert values between different units of Ether as Wei, Shannon, and Finney.

node web3-interaction.js
