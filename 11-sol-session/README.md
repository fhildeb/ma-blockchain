# Solidity Session

Small application examples of various programming techniques in Solidity.

- `Called Contract`: Simple smart contract that contains a single public variable that is updatable.
- `Caller Contract`: Smart contract that interacts with the called contract, defines an interface.
- `First Assambly`: Demonstrates the use of assembly to perform a simple addition operation.
- `If Assambly`: Shows the use of assembly for conditional operations for mathematical comparisons.
- `Loop Assambly`: Solidity assembly contract to implement a simple loop
- `My Account`: Combines the functionality of Ownable and Destructible contracts: Store and withdraw funds while providing the ability to transfer ownership or dissolve the contract.
- `Switch Assambly`: Demonstrates the use of assembly to perform conditional operations with a switch statement
- `Test Payable`: Shows the use of the payable keyword to send and receives Ether from the caller
